# My-Omakub Setup

This is my personal take on the amazing [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub) setup.  

I love the original project and everything it does to streamline a developer environment, but I wanted to take it a step further and make it **more personalized** for my own workflow and preferences.  

## What’s Different

- Added scripts for installing apps I use daily (e.g., Keepassxc, Logseq, Thunderbird).
- Added the Clipboard Indicator gnome extension.  
- Adjusted configurations to match my dev environment and style.  
- Some additional aliases for Docker
- removed the following app scripts: Spotify, Retroarch, Basecamp, Hey, Obsidian, Typora, Xournalapp, 1password, Audacity, Doom Emacs, OBS, Signal, Whatsapp, Zed, Zoom

## Install

use `wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertLikesCoding/my-omakub/main/boot.sh | bash`

## Notes

This fork is not meant to be contributed back to the original Omakub project. It exists purely for my own convenience, to make setting up my development environment easier and faster.
